## Final Project: Supreme Court Verdict Prediction
As the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court hears cases that impact the countryâ€™s social,
political and economic future. The outcomes of these decisions trickle down and impact our day
to day lives as well. In this paper, we aim to predict the outcome of Supreme Court hearings
solely using oral arguments of judges and advocates. We process a total of 667 cases from 2010 -
2019. We fine-tune and deploy a total of 4 models which include logistic regression, simple neural
network, multiple tree-based models, and BERT. Through many iterations of model input, and loss
functions, we find that the BERT model provides us with the highest accuracy of 69%.
